<p>Since its foundation in 1949, the IB has been committed to helping people. Shortly after the end of the war countless young people were orphaned, uprooted and unemployed. Many of them had never gone to school and had no future prospects. The Internationaler Bund (IB) for Cultural and Social Work, as it was called at the time, set itself the goal of supporting young people. The core message of the IB has not changed since then. At the IB we are committed to people regardless of their background, social rank or past experiences. The IB is committed to the sustainable ,holistic and long-term development of the human being. Each and every person is considered to be an enrichment and an important part of society. In its mission statement and vision of mankind, the IB tries to eliminate any barrier in the life of both the individual and society and to grant everyone the right to develop freely, to take responsibility and to participate actively in the development of society. Our vision: Strengthening Being Human.</p>
