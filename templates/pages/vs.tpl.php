<h2>Educating. Voluntary Services</h2>
<p>The IB has been accompanying voluntary services for young people for more than 50 years. In these services, mostly young people under 27 years of age can volunteer in the social and ecological fields as well as in culture and sports – in institutions worldwide – for a certain period of time (generally 12 months). According to our guiding principles, we motivate people through voluntary services to develop freely, to shape their own life, to integrate into society, to assume personal responsibility and to contribute actively to the development of society in Germany, Europe and worldwide. True to the motto ‘I win, you win’, our volunteers are not only committed to assuming an active role in supporting their fellow citizens and their environment: they are also given the opportunity to gain valuable experiences and to improve their personal and social competences.</p>
